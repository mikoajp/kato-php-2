KATO PHP
========

We are looking for a clean and proper solution, using standard design patterns that are PHP object-oriented.
The test should not take longer than about couple hours to finish - however, take as much time as you need within the time frame, as finishing earlier will not give you any advantages. 
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.

There are two parts "first-part" and "second-part". Each part is different, if you are having
issues with the first part then you can move to the second part. You don't have to finish all.
Please try to do as much as you can.

In each part you will find README.md please follow its instructions.
